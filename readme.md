## What is This?

The Scrum Guide Expansion Pack was created because the world in which we build products has changed—and continues to change rapidly.

Scrum, as defined in the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/), is still solid and useful. But many practitioners, leaders, and teams found themselves asking deeper questions:
– How do we stay focused on real outcomes, not just shipping features?
– How do we work when AI becomes part of the team?
– How do we apply Scrum in fast-moving environments without losing its simplicity?

The Expansion Pack is a response to those questions. It’s not a replacement of the Scrum Guide. It’s an optional companion—a way to support people who already use Scrum but feel they need more guidance to navigate today’s realities.

The motivation wasn’t to add more rules or make Scrum heavier. Quite the opposite: it was to clarify the spirit of Scrum, especially around product thinking, emergence, and strategic focus. Scrum has always been about enabling teams to learn fast, adapt, and deliver value. The Expansion Pack helps modern teams keep that spirit alive—especially in environments shaped by uncertainty, acceleration, and new technology.

## Encouraged Contribution Workflow

Changes to content can often be contentious, culturally sensitive, and difficult to manage effectively. To navigate these complexities, we encourage the following collaborative workflow for contributors to the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack:

1. **Create a Discussion** – Engage peers in a conversation about the proposed change, aiming for consensus. Include all perspectives that could provide valuable insights.
2. **Create an Issue** – Once consensus is reached, \[create an issue] clearly documenting the change and attributing all participants.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** – Follow standard GitHub procedures: fork the repository, implement the change, and submit a Pull Request.
4. **Review the Pull Request** – The original creators (Jeff, John, Ralph) or their delegates will review your submission, and may approve, comment, or reject the proposed change.
