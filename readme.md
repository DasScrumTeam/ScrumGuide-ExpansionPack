# Scrum Guide Expansion Pack

The Scrum Guide Expansion Pack was created because the world in which we build products has changed—and continues to change rapidly.

Scrum, as defined in the 2020 Guide, is still solid and useful. But many practitioners, leaders, and teams found themselves asking deeper questions:
– How do we stay focused on real outcomes, not just shipping features?
– How do we work when AI becomes part of the team?
– How do we apply Scrum in fast-moving environments without losing its simplicity?

The Expansion Pack is a response to those questions.

It’s not a replacement of the Scrum Guide. It’s an optional companion—a way to support people who already use Scrum but feel they need more guidance to navigate today’s realities.
The motivation wasn’t to add more rules or make Scrum heavier. Quite the opposite: it was to clarify the spirit of Scrum, especially around product thinking, emergence, and strategic focus.
Scrum has always been about enabling teams to learn fast, adapt, and deliver value. The Expansion Pack helps modern teams keep that spirit alive—especially in environments shaped by uncertainty, acceleration, and new technology.
