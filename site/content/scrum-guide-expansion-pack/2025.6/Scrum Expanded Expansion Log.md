title: Scrum Expanded Expansion Log of the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack 2025
description: The Scrum Guide Expansion Pack is a comprehensive companion to the 2020 Scrum Guide, created to help professionals navigate today’s complex product environments. It deepens understanding of core Scrum principles by offering additional guidance on complexity, product thinking, systems of work, and leadership; while remaining true to Scrum’s ethos of empiricism and self-management. It’s not a rewrite, but a strategic amplification to support long-term, value-driven delivery in modern teams.

Suggestions

- Clarification and modification of responsibilities while ‘embracing fuzziness’ (73)
- From Scrum is immutable or simple to Scrum is evolving, in some cases, softened wording from 'must' to 'should'
- Product Owner accountability to Product Owner role with accountability; maximizing long-term value
- Developers accountability to Product Developer role with accountability
- Scrum Master accountability to Scrum Master role with accountability; Scrum Master is one person, not AI
- Product Developers may be human or AI, or helped by AI, at least one human; more human Product Developers are better for cognitive diversity and addressing complexity
- Scrum Team commits to the Sprint Goal, not the former Developers; important that Product Owner is focused
- Sprint Backlog toward Sprint Goal or Product Goal, not just Sprint Goal
- Product definition, mention of Product strategy, roadmaps, Product models, scaling, goal-oriented approaches
- Emphasis on learning, result-feedback, side effects, outcomes over outputs
- To preserve the flow of value, incomplete Product Backlog items don’t have to return to the Product Backlog
- Definition of Done renamed to Definition of Output Done
- Emphasis on full Product life-cycle, full feature life-cycle, and value realization
- Sprint Planning Topics 1-3 renamed to the Why, What, and How; Sprint up to 4 weeks rather than up to 1 month
- Possible additional review of the Increment and outcomes in a psychologically safer environment at the Sprint Retrospective
- More emphasis that the Increment is always Done, hence 'Done Increment' is superfluous
- Explicit about the malleability of the Product Goal (within reason)
- From the optimistic assumption of value delivery to an intentional _Focus_ on value realization
- Ethos of built-in quality, clarity, data-informed decisions, intentional interactions, emergence (71), outcomes over outputs, pause & reflection, realizing value, understanding the problem or opportunity, fostering the climate/environment for a coherent Scrum adoption, and continuous improvement in a direction
- De-emphasis of the nebulous organization in order to attach the change to roles
- More intentional observance of the Scrum Values, considering the context
