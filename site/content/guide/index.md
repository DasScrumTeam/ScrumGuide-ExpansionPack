title: The Scrum Guide Expansion Pack
description: A generic guide for users to follow.
guide_whatis: |
  The **Scrum Guide Expansion Pack** exists because the way we build products keeps changing.

  The [2020 Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) remains solid, but many practitioners began asking deeper questions: how to stay focused on outcomes, how to work with AI in the team, and how to keep Scrum simple in fast-moving environments.

  This Expansion Pack responds to those questions. It doesn’t replace the Scrum Guide; it complements it. It’s for those already using Scrum but needing more clarity in today’s context.

  The goal wasn’t to add rules, but to reinforce the spirit of Scrum; especially around product thinking, emergence, and strategic focus.

  Scrum is about learning fast, adapting, and delivering value. The Expansion Pack helps teams do just that, even in uncertain, accelerated, tech-driven settings.
